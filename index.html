    <h1></h1><center>DORAEMON</center><hr>
    <pr>Doraemon is a male robotic earless cat that travels back in time from the 22nd century to aid a preteen boy named Nobita. An official birth certificate for the character gives him a birth date of 3 September 2112 and lists his city of residency as Kawasaki, Kanagawa, the city where the manga was created.[6] In 2008, Japan's Foreign Ministry appointed <b>Doraemon the country's "anime ambassador"</b>.
    <h2>Doraemon character</h2>
    <pr><u>Doraemon's physical appearance changed as the manga progressed</u>. At first, he was predominantly kingfish color, with a blue tail, a white stomach, and flesh-colored hands and feet. He also stooped, and had a body much larger than his head. In later issues, he sported a smaller body, white hands and feet, and a red tail the appearance most identified with him today. In the 1995 short film 2112: The Birth of Doraemon (as well as The Doraemons story arc set in the Robot School), it is revealed that<u> Doraemon's original paint color was yellow, and had a more high-pitched voice than his current counterpart</u>. After getting his ears gnawed off by a robot mouse at the 22nd century Nobi's residence, he slipped into depression on top of a tower, where he erroneously drank a potion labeled "sadness" instead of "happiness". As he wept, the yellow color washed off and his voice changed due to the potion. As a result, he developed a morbid fear of mice despite being a robotic cat.
